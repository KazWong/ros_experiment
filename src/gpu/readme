CPU Profiler
Analyzing Text Output

Text mode has lines of output that look like this:

       14   2.1%  17.2%       58   8.7% std::_Rb_tree::find

Here is how to interpret the columns:

    Number of profiling samples in this function
    Percentage of profiling samples in this function
    Percentage of profiling samples in the functions printed so far
    Number of profiling samples in this function and its callees
    Percentage of profiling samples in this function and its callees
    Function name

   ...

    The first column contains the direct memory use in MB.
    The fourth column contains memory use by the procedure and all of its callees.
    The second and fifth columns are just percentage representations of the numbers in the first and fourth columns.
    The third column is a cumulative sum of the second column (i.e., the kth entry in the third column is the sum of the first k entries in the second column.)
